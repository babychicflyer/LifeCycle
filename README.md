** How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I have been learning how to do this recently, and I have found that putting the requests in a written list at first helped. Then, after the list was made, I got more details and created the user stories. Having user stories makes it extremely easy to keep track of what we need/want, and keeping them in a Product Log that's updated daily is essential to keeping it organized. 
  
** How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I hope to do everything that involves Agile development. That would mean I am in my chosen field with an endless amount of things to learn. I would like to start working on the beginning planning stages. I am a sucker for details and lists so making the log or helping with it would be a dream. I love this fact about Agile because it includes every change that is made to each user story and while staying neat and organized.
  
**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member in a software development team means I have wonderful communication skills. Being able to talk to anyone and communicate through many means makes for a team member who can help and be reached by everyone, as it should be in a team. I would ask for help from one I knew I could get it from, therefore being timely and humble. I like integrity and honesty. I have it in spades, and I know with the knowledge I am gaining in this industry, I will make a great team member who accomplishes much.
